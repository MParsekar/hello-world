A place where my ideas as a coder will be highlighted, improvements and suggestion are accepted
I am a student from goa University, Goa, India. Love Coding and exoerimenting with new features and applying it what i like to do the most but coding is secondary once I know the basics, logic design and implementing it in the code is all i like to do.
